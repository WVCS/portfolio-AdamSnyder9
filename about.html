  <h3> He's truly a Gentleman </h3>
  <p> Gordon Ramsay is obviously human, which means he has feelings too. He is respectable towards women and men but not always in the kitchen. In Gordon Ramsay's shows, Hell's Kitchen and Master Chef, he shows splendid talent in his teaching and cooking skills. But often, he is furious. In Hell's kitchen, he curses, yells, screams, and throws things at people, but this is only to motivate these idiot chefs to do their job.The show would never be the same if he had not been hard on these fools who try their best to be like Gordon Ramsay. However, when Ramsay is off screen, we can clearly see his true self. He comes from the United Kingdom, Johnstone, where in this area, manners play a huge part of everyday life which of course Ramsey has. Proper manners go a big away to atracting women as well as men, therefore Ramsey is proper. </p>
