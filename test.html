 <h3> I know why he has a heart </h3>
  <p> Gordon Ramsay may seem like a horrible human being by the mean, cruel, demeaning comments he lashes at people, but he is human too, he is married, with three daughters and one son. Appreantly a women was so in love with Ramsey that she wanted to be with him the rest of his life. Gordan Ramsay might be harsh on screen, but he is a softy in his personal life. We need to udnerstand his cruel personality on tv is different from his actual self, plus, when Ramsay goes ape &*@# on his chefs, he's only making them better. Life without Ramsay is pointless because he is a God.  </p>
