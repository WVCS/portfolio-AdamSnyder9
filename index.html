<h2> Gordon Ramsay Has a Heart </h2>
  <body>
<div class="Nugget">
     <h3> I know why </h3>
  <p> Gordon Ramsay may seem like a horrible human being by the mean, cruel, demeaning comments he lashes at people, but he is human too, he is married, with three daughters and one son. Appreantly a women was so in love with Ramsey that she wanted to be with him the rest of his life. Gordan Ramsay might be harsh on screen, but he is a softy in his personal life. We need to udnerstand his cruel personality on tv is different from his actual self, plus, when Ramsay goes ape &*@# on his chefs, he's only making them better. Life without Ramsay is pointless because he is a God.  </p>
  <h3> He's truly a Gentleman </h3>
  <p> Gordon Ramsay is obviously human, which means he has feelings too. He is respectable towards women and men but not always in the kitchen. In Gordon Ramsay's shows, Hell's Kitchen and Master Chef, he shows splendid talent in his teaching and cooking skills. But often, he is furious. In Hell's kitchen, he curses, yells, screams, and throws things at people, but this is only to motivate these idiot chefs to do their job.The show would never be the same if he had not been hard on these fools who try their best to be like Gordon Ramsay. However, when Ramsay is off screen, we can clearly see his true self. He comes from the United Kingdom, Johnstone, where in this area, manners play a huge part of everyday life which of course Ramsey has. Proper manners go a big away to atracting women as well as men, therefore Ramsey is proper. </p>
